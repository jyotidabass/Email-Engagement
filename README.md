Email Engagement Prediction
Overview
This project predicts email engagement, a crucial aspect of marketing strategies, using machine learning. The goal is to develop models that accurately predict whether recipients will engage with emails.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand email engagement characteristics.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, address redundant columns, and prepare the dataset for model development.

Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from email content to enhance model performance.

Model Development: Use Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression to predict email engagement.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Next Steps: Identify areas for improvement, suggest future enhancements, and outline a roadmap.

Usage
Explore Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks - EDA and Modelling.
